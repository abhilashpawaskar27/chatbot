A front-end solution for package tracking  
Author: Abhilash Pawaskar  
  

 Overview  
- This chatbot provides interactive package tracking using front-end technologies.  
- Users enter a tracking ID to receive package details dynamically.  
- Implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive, user-friendly experience.

Code Structure & Functionality  
 Front-End Architecture  
1️⃣ HTML (Defines Structure)  
   - Container for chat interface (`.chat-container`).  
   - Input field (`userInput`) and send button (`sendBtn`).  
   - Dynamic message display (`chatBox`).  

2️⃣ CSS (Enhances UI/UX)  
   - Styling chat bubbles for bot vs. user messages.  
   - `flexbox` for alignment, ensuring a clean UI.  
   - `box-shadow` for modern design aesthetics.  

3️⃣ JavaScript (Interactive Logic)  
   - Message Handling: `appendMessage()` adds user & bot responses dynamically.  
   - Tracking ID Validation: Ensures correct 3-digit input before generating results.  
   - Package Details Retrieval: `getPackageDetails()` assigns categories based on ID range.  
   - Scrolling Behavior: Keeps chat view seamless as messages load.  
   - Event Listeners: Handles user actions via `click` & `keypress`.
